# flappy-bird-AI

Evolutionary algorithm training a flappy bird AI. Each bird, as a red ball, is controlled by a multilayer perceptron to perform two actions: jump or nothing. A population of birds is initialized at random and perform until all the birds died. After that, a new generation of birds is created using crossover and mutation of the members of the previous generation.
